# Cycles

## Function signature

Deferred annotations can result in cycles in resolving a function signature:

```py
from __future__ import annotations

# error: [invalid-type-form]
def f(x: f):
    pass

reveal_type(f)  # revealed: def f(x: Unknown)
```

## Unpacking

See: <https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/364>

```py
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x: int = 0, y: int = 0) -> None:
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def replace_with(self, other: "Point") -> None:
        self.x, self.y = other.x, other.y

p = Point()
reveal_type(p.x)  # revealed: int
reveal_type(p.y)  # revealed: int
```

## Unpacking a recursively growing tuple

This is a regression test for <https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/3838>.

```py
while 1:
    # error: [possibly-unresolved-reference]
    # error: [possibly-unresolved-reference]
    x = (*x, x)

while 1:
    y = (y, *y)
```

## Generic `NamedTuple` with recursive fields

This is a regression test for <https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/3872>. Computing the
`NamedTuple` fields while building the class's MRO must not try to determine whether the same class
is a `TypedDict`.

```toml
[environment]
python-version = "3.14"
```

```py
from typing import NamedTuple

class Node[KT, VT](NamedTuple):
    children: tuple[Node[KT, VT], ...] | tuple[Leaf[VT], ...]

class Leaf[VT](NamedTuple):
    values: tuple[VT, ...]
```

## Literal reduction during cycle recovery

This is a regression test for <https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/3851>. Constructing a union
during cycle recovery must not run redundancy checks between a literal and a protocol instance.
Resolving the protocol interface can depend on the expression inference query that is already being
recovered, which would introduce a new Salsa cycle.

```toml
[environment]
python-version = "3.14"
```

```py
from typing import Protocol, runtime_checkable

_: Any

@property
def prop(self) -> A:
    raise NotImplementedError

@runtime_checkable
class B(Protocol):
    _: A

x = 5

while isinstance(x, B):
    x = B()  # error: [call-non-callable]

type(x)
x = 2

from typing import Any, assert_type

assert_type(prop, property)

if bool:
    x = 5

while isinstance(x, B):
    x = B()  # error: [call-non-callable]

class A: ...
```

## Literal widening during cycle recovery

Once a recursively growing group of integer literals widens to `int`, later iterations must not
reintroduce individual literals. Otherwise, the inferred type continues changing and the cycle never
converges. This is a reduced regression test from SciPy's iterative sparse solvers.

```py
def solve(maxiter, a, b, c, d, e):
    iteration = 0
    stop = 0
    while iteration < maxiter:
        iteration = iteration + 1
        if iteration >= maxiter:
            stop = 7
        if a:
            stop = 6
        if b:
            stop = 5
        if c:
            stop = 4
        if d:
            stop = 3
        if e:
            stop = 2
        if stop > 0:
            break
    return stop
```

## Self-referential bare type alias

```toml
[environment]
python-version = "3.12"  # typing.TypeAliasType
```

```py
from typing import Union, TypeAliasType, Sequence, Mapping

A = list["A | None"]

def f(x: A):
    # TODO: should be `list[A | None]`?
    reveal_type(x)  # revealed: list[Divergent]
    # TODO: should be `A | None`?
    reveal_type(x[0])  # revealed: Divergent

JSONPrimitive = Union[str, int, float, bool, None]
JSONValue = TypeAliasType("JSONValue", 'Union[JSONPrimitive, Sequence["JSONValue"], Mapping[str, "JSONValue"]]')

def _(x: JSONValue):
    reveal_type(x)  # revealed: Sequence[JSONValue] | int | float | None | Mapping[str, JSONValue]
```

## Self-referential legacy type variables

```py
from typing import Generic, TypeVar

B = TypeVar("B", bound="Base")  # error: [missing-type-argument]

class Base(Generic[B]):
    pass
```

## Parameter default values

This is a regression test for <https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1402>. When a parameter has a
default value that references the callable itself, we currently prevent infinite recursion by simply
falling back to `Unknown` for the type of the default value, which does not have any practical
impact except for the displayed type. We could also consider inferring `Divergent` when we encounter
too many layers of nesting (instead of just one), but that would require a type traversal which
could have performance implications. So for now, we mainly make sure not to panic or stack overflow
for these seemingly rare cases.

### Functions

```py
class C:
    def f(self: "C"):
        def inner_a(positional=self.a):
            return
        self.a = inner_a
        # revealed: def inner_a(positional = ...)
        reveal_type(inner_a)

        def inner_b(*, kw_only=self.b):
            return
        self.b = inner_b
        # revealed: def inner_b(*, kw_only = ...)
        reveal_type(inner_b)

        def inner_c(positional_only=self.c, /):
            return
        self.c = inner_c
        # revealed: def inner_c(positional_only = ..., /)
        reveal_type(inner_c)

        def inner_d(*, kw_only=self.d):
            return
        self.d = inner_d
        # revealed: def inner_d(*, kw_only = ...)
        reveal_type(inner_d)
```

We do, however, still check assignability of the default value to the parameter type:

```py
class D:
    def f(self: "D"):
        # error: [invalid-parameter-default] "Default value of type `(a: int = ...) -> None` is not assignable to annotated parameter type `int`"
        def inner_a(a: int = self.a): ...
        self.a = inner_a
```

### Lambdas

```py
class C:
    def f(self: "C"):
        self.a = lambda positional=self.a: positional
        self.b = lambda *, kw_only=self.b: kw_only
        self.c = lambda positional_only=self.c, /: positional_only
        self.d = lambda *, kw_only=self.d: kw_only

        # revealed: (positional: Divergent = ...) -> Divergent
        reveal_type(self.a)

        # revealed: (*, kw_only: (*, kw_only: Divergent = ...) -> Divergent = ...) -> Divergent
        reveal_type(self.b)

        # revealed: (positional_only: Divergent = ..., /) -> Divergent
        reveal_type(self.c)

        # revealed: (*, kw_only: (*, kw_only: Divergent = ...) -> Divergent = ...) -> Divergent
        reveal_type(self.d)
```

## Self-referential implicit attributes

```py
class Cyclic:
    def __init__(self, data: str | dict):  # error: [missing-type-argument]
        self.data = data

    def update(self):
        if isinstance(self.data, str):
            self.data = {"url": self.data}

# revealed: str | dict[Unknown, Unknown] | dict[str, str]
reveal_type(Cyclic("").data)
```

## Cycle normalization preserves non-gradual variadic parameters

Normalizing a recursive implicit-attribute type does not reinterpret specialized variadic parameters
as gradual:

```py
from typing import Any, Callable, Generic, TypeVar
from ty_extensions import static_assert
from ty_extensions._internal import TypeOf, is_subtype_of

T = TypeVar("T")
flag: bool

class C(Generic[T]):
    def method(self, *args: T, **kwargs: T) -> None: ...

c = C[Any]()

class Recursive:
    def __init__(self, other: "Recursive"):
        self.callback = c.method if flag else other.callback

def check(value: Recursive):
    reveal_type(value.callback)  # revealed: bound method C[Any].method(*args: Any, **kwargs: Any)
    static_assert(is_subtype_of(TypeOf[value.callback], Callable[[], None]))
```

## Decorated methods with implicit class attributes

This is a regression test for <https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/3471>.

```py
from collections.abc import Callable
from typing import TypeVar

class A: ...

T = TypeVar("T")
U = TypeVar("U", bound=A)
C = Callable[[T, U], object]

def d() -> Callable[[C[U, A]], object]:
    raise NotImplementedError

class B:
    @d()
    def m1(self, p):
        pass

    @d()
    def m2(self, p):
        self.__slots__  # error: [unresolved-attribute]
```

## Function annotation and dynamic `NamedTuple` / `NewType`

This is a regression test for <https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/3485> and
<https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/3682>. Type traversal during cycle recovery should not force
the lazy base of a `NewType`.

```py
class C:
    pass

def f():
    pass

def g() -> T:  # error: [unresolved-reference]
    pass

g()

from typing import NamedTuple, NewType

X = NamedTuple("X", [("x", "X")]), None  # error: [invalid-type-form]

list(X)
min(X)  # error: [invalid-argument-type]
T = f()

X = NewType("X", C)
```

The runtime callable returned by `NewType` also carries the lazy base and must use the same
cycle-safe traversal.

```py
class C: ...

def f(): ...
def g() -> T: ...

g()
from typing import NamedTuple, NewType

X = NewType("X", C)
Y = NamedTuple("Y", [("a", "Y")]), X  # error: [invalid-type-form]
min(Y)  # error: [invalid-argument-type]
T = f()
```

## Lazy cached property behind `hasattr`

This pattern used to panic with "too many cycle iterations".

```py
class Cached:
    def get(self) -> int:
        return 0

    @property
    def metadata(self) -> int:
        if not hasattr(self, "_metadata"):
            self._metadata = self.get()
        return self._metadata

reveal_type(Cached().metadata)  # revealed: int
```

## Decorator defined on a base class with constrained typevars, accessed from a subclass with decorated generic parameters

This example was minimized from
[a real issue in `robotframework`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/2637#issuecomment-3807037935).
It created
[a complicated cycle with multiple cycle heads](https://gist.github.com/oconnor663/c996ed2cc97d172dd4b9a8d8207dc7ac),
which also involved
[a tricky Salsa behavior that comes up when a query oscillates between being a cycle head and not being one](https://gist.github.com/oconnor663/c2a7662e3d88048b691754da957121d1).

`entry.py`:

```py
from derived import Derived

Derived.decorate
# revealed: bound method <class 'Derived'>.decorate[T](item_class: type[T]) -> type[T]
reveal_type(Derived.decorate)
```

`derived.py`:

```py
from ty_extensions._internal import reveal_mro
import bases

class Derived(bases.GenericBase["Foo", "Bar"]): ...

@Derived.decorate
class Foo(bases.Foo): ...

# revealed: <class 'Foo'>
reveal_type(Foo)
# revealed: (<class 'derived.Foo'>, <class 'bases.Foo'>, <class 'object'>)
reveal_mro(Foo)

@Derived.decorate
class Bar(bases.Bar): ...

# revealed: <class 'Bar'>
reveal_type(Bar)
# revealed: (<class 'derived.Bar'>, <class 'bases.Bar'>, <class 'object'>)
reveal_mro(Bar)
```

`bases.py`:

```py
from typing import Generic, TypeVar, Type
from ty_extensions._internal import reveal_mro

T = TypeVar("T")
B1 = TypeVar("B1", bound="Foo")
B2 = TypeVar("B2", bound="Bar")

class GenericBase(Generic[B1, B2]):
    @classmethod
    def decorate(cls, item_class: Type[T]) -> Type[T]:
        return item_class

# revealed: <class 'GenericBase'>
reveal_type(GenericBase)
# revealed: (<class 'GenericBase[Unknown, Unknown]'>, typing.Generic, <class 'object'>)
reveal_mro(GenericBase)
# revealed: (<class 'GenericBase[Foo, Bar]'>, typing.Generic, <class 'object'>)
reveal_mro(GenericBase["Foo", "Bar"])

class Foo: ...
class Bar: ...
```

## a tuple grown in a loop widens rather than diverging

`key += (x,)` makes the tuple one element longer on every trip, so the fixpoint sees `tuple[T]`,
then `tuple[T] | tuple[T, T]`, then one more union member each iteration — a sequence with no fixed
point, which used to run until salsa gave up. a variable-length tuple *is* one, and it is a
supertype of every member.

```py
def bounded() -> None:
    key = (1,)
    for _ in range(3):
        key += (2,)
    reveal_type(key)  # revealed: tuple[Literal[1, 2], ...]

def unbounded(n: int) -> object:
    key = (1,)
    while True:
        key += (2,)
        if len(key) > n:
            return key

def two_lengths(flag: bool) -> None:
    # *two* tuples of different length in a union is an ordinary type a program can
    # mean, and stays one — only a growing run of them is folded
    pair = (1, 2) if flag else (1, 2, 3)
    reveal_type(pair)  # revealed: tuple[Literal[1], Literal[2]] | tuple[Literal[1], Literal[2], Literal[3]]
```

## a container that nests itself in a loop widens rather than diverging

`stack.append((stack.pop(), a, b))` makes the element type one level *deeper* on every trip, so the
fixpoint sees `list[tuple[T, T, T]]`, then `list[tuple[tuple[T, T, T], T, T]]`, and one more level
each iteration. the type it is reaching for is recursive and cannot be written down, so the
supertype to settle on is the container with its arguments unknown — which is what a checker without
flow-sensitive specializations infers for the same loop.

two things had to hold for this to converge. a type built entirely out of `Unknown` never acquires a
divergence marker, so depth is the only signal that it is still growing; and the event timeline of a
fluid specialization has to be *retained* rather than replaced when an iteration produces fewer
events than the last, or the two alternate forever.

```py
def walk(dirs, nondirs, top):
    stack = [top]
    while stack:
        top = stack.pop()
        stack.append((top, dirs, nondirs))

def nested_dict(key: str) -> None:
    seen = {}
    while key:
        seen[key] = seen
        key = key[1:]

def shallow_nesting() -> None:
    # nesting a program actually writes is left alone: this is three levels, not a run
    # that gains one on every trip
    boxed: list[list[list[int]]] = [[[1]]]
    reveal_type(boxed)  # revealed: list[list[list[int]]]
```

## a function whose return value nests itself widens rather than diverging

An unannotated function can hand back a container built out of its own return value. Inferring its
signature then asks what it returns in order to answer what it returns, and each round buries the
answer one level deeper: `Box[Never]`, then `Box[Box[Never]]`, and so on. Nothing in the program
says where that recursion stops, so the rounds never settle.

The recovery is the same as for a container nested in a loop, but the growth has to be recognized
first: by the first round the divergence marker has been solved away — `Box[Divergent]` comes back
as `Box[Never]` — leaving nothing for the usual collapse to find. What gives the round away is that
it added nothing but depth: its answer is the previous answer with one more layer around it. Once
the marker is put back the nesting collapses and the iteration settles on the recursive type.

```toml
[environment]
python-version = "3.12"
```

```py
from typing import Callable

class Box[T]:
    def __init__(self, make: Callable[[], T]) -> None:
        self.make = make

def factory():
    return Box(factory)

reveal_type(factory())  # revealed: Box[Divergent]

# the binding that observes it is one construction further out, and stays finite
outer = Box(factory)
reveal_type(outer)  # revealed: Box[Box[Divergent]]

# an unannotated factory that is not recursive is unaffected, and still inferred exactly
def plain():
    return 1

def holder():
    return Box(plain)

reveal_type(holder())  # revealed: Box[Literal[1]]
```

## the recursive `defaultdict` factory converges

The same shape reaches ty through the standard library, where it is a common idiom for a tree of
arbitrary depth.

```py
from collections import defaultdict

def tree():
    return defaultdict(tree)

reveal_type(tree())  # revealed: defaultdict[Unknown, Divergent]

nested = defaultdict(tree)
reveal_type(nested)  # revealed: defaultdict[Unknown, defaultdict[Unknown, Divergent]]
```
